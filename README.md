## Overview

### The challenge

Learning Journal: The project aim was to build a three-page blog site comprising home page, about me page and feature page. The site was built from scratch according to a Figma design spec. Most of the images used were exported from the Figma file. Additional images for the blog-cards were downloaded from Unsplash plus personal photo used for about me page. All project requirements were met as follows:
- Build each page from scratch using HTML and CSS;
- Make all pages responsive including: relative units, mobile first design, media queries, flex-box (css-grid) skills, viewport meta tag;
